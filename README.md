# Recommendation-engine-analysis-using-Surprise-Library

## Objective

The key objectives of this program is to demonstrate how to train and evaluate a non-
trivial machine learning model under tight time constraints. The task is estimating
a user review score in a recommendation system. It has given a set of training
features that contain a label which is the reviewer score for a specific alcoholic beverage
between 0 and 5, but on a real scale and not an integer scale. Apologies in advance
if you are not a consumer of alcohol for many good reasons â€“ it just happens to be
a reasonable test collection to use for our evaluation. Most movie reviews or item
reviews work similarly to this problem, but may not have as many features available.
the task here is to research this problem, demonstrate a suitable solution, train a model, and
produce a result file from a training set that will be scored using standard evaluation
measures in Recommendation Systems.
